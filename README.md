# TriangleGame
This is a command-line game that mimics the Triangle Peg Game. 
In this game you have a triangle that has 15 holes (one hole in the first row, 2 holes in the second, 3 holes in the third...).
You have 14 pegs in all but one of the holes. The goal is to remove as many pegs as possible from the board.
Ideally, you will end up with only one peg left. The fewer pegs remaining when no more moves are possible, the better.
The way you can remove pegs is by taking a peg and jumping over an adjacent peg so that the original peg lands
in an empty hole. You remove the peg that was jumped over.
You can move the pegs on the board according to 
Three pegs remaining is ok but not excellent.
Two pegs remaining is good but still not excellent.
One peg remaining is excellent! That is the goal.
